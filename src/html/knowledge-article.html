                  <p>In the US, concern surrounding anthropogenic climate change is growing, alongside increased
                    interest to learn about environmental sustainability (1). While many champion individual action,
                    such as recycling or purchasing electric vehicles, collective action and structural changes, such as
                    total decarbonization, are necessary. There are many avenues to become more engaged in environmental
                    work, whether it be through volunteering with a community-based organization or even incorporating
                    sustainability into your career. </p>
                  <p>In the US, a significant portion of carbon emissions are attributed to the construction and
                    operation of buildings. Buildings in cities like San Francisco and New York are recognizing the
                    significant impact of their emissions, and are beginning to work towards energy efficiency via LEED
                    Certifications and ENERGY STAR labels. The increasing demand for such certifications within the past
                    5 years calls for the hiring of consultants, engineers, and sustainability professionals. Companies
                    like Sustainable Investment Group (SIG), and other environmental service companies, even hire
                    college-aged interns to help foster a new generation of sustainability professionals. </p>

                  <p>Degree programs that incorporate sustainability science alongside the traditional course of study
                    are becoming more widely available, making studying your personal interests and their intersections
                    with environmental causes more accessible. UC Berkeley and UC Davis, for example, offer BA programs
                    in Sustainable Environmental Design, an interdisciplinary major that focuses on sustainable design
                    at multiple scales of the built environment (2). Some examples of additional tracks that may not
                    specifically address sustainability but can still lead to a career in environmental industries
                    include Biology, Environmental Engineering, Agroecology, Mechanical Engineering, and Law. I had the
                    chance to interview Libby Dunne, Sustainability Consultant for SIG and 2020 college graduate, to
                    find out more about her current role and her path to this position. </p>
                  <p>What is the major and minor that you graduated with?</p>
                  <p>“I majored in Biology with a minor in Environmental Sciences at Emory University.”</p>
                  <p>Why did you choose to minor in Environmental Services?</p>
                  <p>“After starting my classes at Emory, I really enjoyed learning about the ecology side of biology
                    and learning more about the environment that surrounds us. The topics I learned about made me more
                    intrigued to learn about these subjects, so I decided to minor in Environmental Sciences.”</p>
                  <h5 class="title-5">Why did you decide to enter the green building and sustainability market?</h5>
                  <p>“At first I did not know what I was getting into after getting accepted into SIG’s internship
                    program, but I am really glad I did! Getting the opportunity to make a difference in the building
                    industry and being able to contribute towards Fitwel and LEED certifications makes me feel like I am
                    doing my part in fighting against climate change!”</p>

                  <p>Career opportunities within “green” and sustainability industries are vast, and are growing
                    alongside expanding industries. Listed below are various positions that involve sustainability: </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Sustainability Consultant</li>
